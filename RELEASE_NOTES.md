# Airlock v1.0.3 Release Notes

This release focuses on data security, storage reliability, and application stability.

## 🔒 Security & Storage
- **Secure File Storage**: Migrated from browser `localStorage` to a dedicated, encrypted-at-rest file storage (`store.bin`) in the AppData directory. This enhances security by moving sensitive data out of the browser sandbox.
- **Data Safety**: Implemented robust overwrite protection to prevent data loss during startup race conditions.
- **Self-Healing Hydration**: Added a failsafe mechanism to ensure your saved hosts always load, even if the primary storage plugin experiences delays.

## 🛠 Fixes & Improvements
- **Terminal Stability**: Fixed a race condition that caused "Session not found" errors when resizing the terminal immediately after connection.
- **Performance**: Optimized storage adapter with lazy loading for faster application startup.

## ✨ New Features

- **Theme Import**: You can now import custom themes from JSON files stored on your disk.
- **Disk-Based Storage**: Custom themes are saved to your configuration folder for persistence.

### User Interface
- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Added a toggle button to show/hide the sidebar, giving you more space for your terminal.
- **Scrollable Tabs**: The session tab bar now supports horizontal scrolling, handling multiple active connections gracefully.

### Host Management

- **Context Menu Actions**: Added a "New Folder" option to the right-click context menu for quicker folder creation.

### Terminal

This release addresses critical issues with terminal resizing and improves stability.

## 🛠 Fixes & Improvements

### Terminal
- **Fixed Terminal Resize Synchronization**: Resolved an issue where opening text editors like `vim` or `nano` would result in a partial screen render (80x24 characters) instead of using the full available terminal space.
- **Improved Connection Stability**: Implemented a retry mechanism for PTY resizing to ensure the correct terminal dimensions are applied even if the SSH session takes a moment to initialize.
